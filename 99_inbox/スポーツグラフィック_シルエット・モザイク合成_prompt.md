[PERSON NAME]. 
Act as a high-end sports graphic designer creating a conceptual tribute poster. The style is a complex "dual exposure photo-grid composite" with mixed-media textures.
CENTRAL STRUCTURE (THE VESSEL):
The central focus is a large-scale, high-contrast black and white portrait silhouette of [PERSON NAME]. This main portrait acts as the container.
THE GRID FILL & TEXTURES (MIXED MEDIA):
The interior of the silhouette is populated by a dense "photo mosaic grid" of action shots from the person's career.
CRITICAL TEXTURE INSTRUCTION: Do not just paste flat photos. Apply artistic textures to various grid cells to create a tactile, collage feel. Use effects like:
Halftone Dots: Comic-book style raster patterns on some cells.
Fabric/Embroidery: Subtle thread or canvas textures suggesting a jersey or patch.
Film Grain: Heavy noise on specific high-contrast action shots.
COLOR STRATEGY:
The base is Monochrome B&W. Use selective color overlays (relevant to the team/flag) ONLY on specific grid cells to create a rhythm.
TYPOGRAPHY & BRANDING (STRICT MICRO-SCALING):
Top Left (The Name): Write "[PERSON NAME]" strictly using the font Inter Semibold.
Kerning: Tight negative kerning (-4%).
Size: SMALL and discreet. It must occupy MAXIMUM 20% of the canvas width. Do NOT make it large or loud.
Top Right (The Symbol): Place the primary logo (Team/Brand/Flag).
Size: VERY SMALL. It must occupy MAXIMUM 10% of the canvas width.
COMPOSITION & BACKGROUND:
Background: Off-white or light grey with a visible high-quality paper or concrete texture. It should not be flat digital white.

Act as a high-end sports graphic designer. Create a conceptual tribute poster of [DAIYA TONO] inspired directly by the provided reference image. The design style is a complex “dual exposure photo-grid composite” with mixed-media textures optimized for football (soccer).

CENTRAL STRUCTURE — THE VESSEL
A large, high-contrast black-and-white silhouette portrait of [DAIYA TONO], derived from the provided action image: forward motion, pointing gesture, wind-blown hair, strong directional energy. This silhouette acts as the container for the internal composition.

INTERIOR GRID — PHOTO MOSAIC FILL
Inside the silhouette, create a dense photo-grid mosaic composed of:
• explosive dribbling moments
• goal celebrations
• close-ups of cleats hitting turf
• stadium crowd panoramas
• teammates embracing after a score
• intense close-up of facial focus
All grid cells should vary scale to create a rhythmic collage.

CRITICAL TEXTURE INSTRUCTION — MIXED MEDIA
Integrate tactile, football-specific textures:
• Halftone dots (comic-book dynamic movement patterns)
• Jersey mesh fabric texture
• Embroidery texture of crest + logos
• Grass stains + turf blades subtly overlaying lower grid layers
• Pitch line chalk textures brushing diagonally across several cells

COLOR STRATEGY (using your specified club colors)
Base layer = deep monochrome B&W
Apply selective, vibrant overlays ONLY in highlight cells using your supplied color palette:
#e50039／　rgb(229, 0, 57)
#004098／　rgb(0, 64, 152)
#bd9c4b／　rgb(189, 156, 75)

The selective color should appear as:
• gradient strokes across dribbling shots
• rim-lighting accents on key actions
• subtle overlay glows in diagonal motion lines
• color-blocked fragments in 3–5 mosaic cells for compositional rhythm

TYPOGRAPHY & BRANDING
Keep typography micro-scaled and minimal:
• Player name [PERSON NAME] in condensed sans-serif
• Jersey number displayed as micro-outline inside the lower silhouette
• Club name in ultra-small uppercase tracking
• Background = off-white textured paper with faint grain
• Optional gold-foil style rim on the silhouette edge

OVERALL FEEL
Epic, editorial, luxury-grade sports poster.
A balance of realism + collage abstraction, with the provided player image as the dominant anchor.
